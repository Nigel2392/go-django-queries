# Go Django Queries Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `go-django-queries` package.

While [Go-Django](https://github.com/Nigel2392/go-django) tries to do as little as possible with the database, sometimes helper functions make working with models easier.

This library brings Django-style ORM queries to Go-Django, allowing you to:

* Define models with relationships
* Compose queries with filters, ordering, limits
* Use select expressions and annotations

var todos, err := queries.GetQuerySet(&Todo{}).
    Select("*", "User.*").
    Filter("Done", false).
    OrderBy("-ID").
    All()

// Query reverse foreign key relation
var todos, err := queries.GetQuerySet(&User{}).
    Select("*", "TodoSet.*").
    Filter("TodoSet.Done", false).
    OrderBy("-ID").
    All()
```
